<h1>About Me</h1> <!-- I made two different sub-sub-headers here -->
<hr>
<h2>Why do I code?</h2> <!-- I made this one an ordered list because it was originally going to be one big paragraph. -->
<h3><p>
<ol>
<li>I tried coding because I have been poor for a long time and one day I saw an advertisement for thinkful's living stipend program on Facebook.</li>
<li>I applied and I found out that coding is very simple and fun!</li>
<li>I've decided that it must be a great and fun way to make money.</li>
<li>There is a long road to mastery filled with all sorts of people and things to learn.</li>
<li>I am very excited to walk this long road, like the karate sage who sits beneath the waterfall.</li>
<li>Maybe one day I will have my own pupil, who will learn my "ancient arts."</li>
</ol> <!-- tell me i'm funny, please XD -->
</p></h3>

<h2>Other things about me: </h2> <!-- this one also has two subheaders, however they are both unordered lists because they are not meant to be taken in any particular order -->
<h3><p>I like to listen to:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Metal and Rock</li>
<li>Indie music</li> 
<li>Blues</li> 
<li>Folk music</li>
<li>Prog music</li> 
<li>grunge</li>
<li>and sometimes gangster rap from the nineties.</li>
</ul></p> <!-- wasn't too sure about using this paragraph thing with the lists honestly -->
<h3>I also like to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make Music!</li>
<li>Play video games</li> 
<li>Look at memes</li>
<li>Practice the awesome English crafting of the master wordsmith!</li>
